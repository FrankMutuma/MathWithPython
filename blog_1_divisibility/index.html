    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>In this article I will discuss simple methods to find primes numbers. I know that my code is not optimised but the focus is on understanding the code instead of the fastest solution. </p>

    <h2>The basic definitions you should know</h2>
        <h3>1. What is division</h3>
            <p> Division is defined as ax = b for any integer x, then we say that a divides b, or a|b. Conversely, if ax≠b, then a does not divide b, or a ∤ b.</p>
            <p>Ie 3 x 2 = 6 where a is 3, x is 2 and b is 6. Hence 3 divides 6.<p>

        <h3> 2. What is a prime number</h3>
            <p>If an integer p has no divisor other than 1 and itself, else it is a composite number. </p>

    <h2>2. Ways to find if a number is prime</h2>
        <p>Properly defining the question: find if the integer n is prime. </p>

        <h3>1. loop through each 2 to n-1</h3>
            <pre>
            <code>
            def simple_prime_checker(n):
                for i in range(2, n-1): # 1 and the number itself are not checked because we are looking if there is another multiple
                    if n%i == 0: 
                        return False # if there is at one element that is gives no remainder then the number is not prime
                return True
            </code>
            </pre>

        <h3>2. loop through between 2 and sqrt of n</h3>
            <h4>Why only upto sqrt n?</h4>
                <p>If n can be expressed as a product of two integers a and b (i.e., n=a×b), then at least one of those integers must be less than or equal to n. This is because if both a and b were greater than n, their product a×b would exceed n.</p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                import math
                def simple_prime_checker(n):
                    n = float(n)
                    for i in range(2, math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))): # 1 and the number itself are not checked because we are looking if there is another multiple
                        if n%i == 0:
                            return False # if there is at one element that is gives no remainder then the number is not prime
                    return True
                </code>
                </pre>

        <h3>3. Sieve of Eratosthenes </h3>
            <p>It marks all the multiples of all the prime numbers in the range as not being prime starting from 1. The numbers that are left are considered prime.</p>

            <pre>
            <code>
                def sieve(n):
                    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1) # the list represents that all the numbers are prime
                    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False # 0 and 1 are not prime

                    for p in range(2, n):
                        if is_prime[p]: # if the number is prime
                            for multiple in range(p*p, n+1, p): # mark all the multiples as False
                                is_prime[multiple]= False

                    primes = [p for p in range(n + 1) if is_prime[p]] # collect all the indices that are still True
                    return primes
                def is_it_prime(n): # checks if the number is a prime by checking the numbers given by the sieve
                    primes = sieve(n)
                    if n in primes:
                        return True
                    return False
            </code>
            </pre>
